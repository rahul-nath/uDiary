# uDiary

## What?
Think of it as a blog with customized functionality

## Why?
I wanted to keep track of things better without having to manually organize stuff. For example, if I was having a good day and writing about an experience, I just wanted to dynamically group together posts on the go and see what posts ended up clustering together.

## How can I use it?
Figuring out how to package it for the layperson to just start up and start blogging.

## What does this have that I can't get elsewhere?
- You can add links by highlighting a word(s) and typing `CMD-K` and paste your link in the dialog pop-up.
- You can create categories as you're writing by prefacing a word with a `#`; they'll appear as categories in the `blog` dropdown

## What's up next?

- Adding multiple categories
- Streamlining deployment, db initalization, private mode
- Adding media
